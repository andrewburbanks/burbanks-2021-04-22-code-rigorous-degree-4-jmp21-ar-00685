Recall, however, that Feigenbaum's explanation for the observed universality of the scaling factors in the period-doubling scenario posits that the renormalisation operator, $T$, has a hyperbolic fixed point $g_{*}$ thus the linearisation $DT(g_{*})$ has expanding directions and, therefore, $T$ is not a contraction on any such ball.\n",

Firstly, we  cast the fixed point problem as a zero-finding problem by writing $F=T-I$; the fixed points of $T$ are zeros of $F$.  Just as $T$ is not contractive at the desired fixed point, $F$ is not contractive at the corresponding zero.  However, one operator that we might hope to be contractive close enough to its fixed points is the one-step Newton operator:\n",

    "## The rigorous computational framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a computational approach to this problem raises two fundamental issues: (1) the function space in which we work is infinite-dimensional; we therefore need a way to cast the fixed-point problem in a finite way without losing rigour, and (2) the representation of, and arithmetic with, numbers is not exact in the computer; we therefore need a way to bound mathematical computations using quantities that can be represented and computed exactly.  A single idea enables us to tackle both of these problems in one framework, by extending the ideas around interval arithmetic to function spaces.  We implemented a framework for rigorous functional analysis by computer, following the work of [Eckmann, Koch, Wittwer], [Lanford], [Mestel], [MacKay], [Stirnemann], and others.\n",

See, for example, [Krasnosel’skii, 1972, \\S 18].  This means that $0$ is in the spectrum, that all other elements of the spectrum are eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, and that for any other linear operator $L$ such that $\\|L-D\\mathbb{T}(G)\\|\\to 0$, the spectrum of $L$ converges to that of $D\\mathbb{T}(G)$ (except for $0$).  In particular, with increasing truncation degree, the spectra of finite-rank approximations to $D\\mathbb{T}(G)$ converge (with the exception of $0$) to that of $D\\mathbb{T}(G)$ itself."

Let $X$ be a real Banach space, let $m\\le N$ be a positive integer, let $P$ be a continuous projection operator on $X$ of $m$-dimensional range and put $H = I - P$.  We choose $m$ to be at least the number of specific eigenvalues that we wish to isolate.  In this case, it is useful to choose $m\\ge 2$ since $D\\mathbb{T}(G)$ is hyperbolic with expanding directions corresponding to eigenvalues $\\alpha^d$ and $\\delta$, with all other eigenvalues having $|\\lambda|\\le r<1$.  We note that it may be necessary to choose $m$ larger than this desired number in order to achieve tighter bounds; in particular, there are tradeoffs with the truncation degree $N$, the function ball radius $\\rho$, the accuracy of the approximate fixed point, and so on."

We choose an interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ in which to search for eigenvalues of $D\\mathbb{T}(G)$.  This interval may be chosen by noting that the spectral radius of $D\\mathbb{T}(G)$ is bounded by the operator norm which is in turn bounded by the maximum column sum norm.

In case (i), the expression $\\det(C-\\lambda I)$ has been bounded strictly away from zero and thus the interval $\\lambda$ does not contain an eigenvalue.  Case (ii) is inconclusive by itself and we must reason about the pattern of sign changes between any nearest-neighbouring subintervals that fall under case (i) in order to determine whether a zero exists.\n",

Doing this yields the corresponding result that if a rectangle $\\lambda\\subset\\mathbb{C}$ contains a complex eigenvalue of the linear operator $L\\in C$, then the rectangle $\\det(C-\\lambda I)$ contains zero.

    "Notice that the bound on $\\|D\\Psi(B(V^0,\\hat\\rho))(E_{N+1})\\|_1$ is approximately $2$.  This is due to the naive expression for $DF(V)\\delta v$ being used to compute it; this is another symptom of the dependency problem: multiple occurences of the perturbation $\\delta v$ are treated as independent function balls in the rigorous computational framework, each contributing separately to the resulting norm.  The issue is removed by the following reasoning.  Recall that\n",

    "&\\mapsto \\delta V - \\Lambda(DT(G)\\delta V - \\phi(\\delta V)V - \\phi(V)\\delta V).\n",

    "There is a dependency problem due to the terms $\\delta V$ and $-\\Lambda\\phi(V)\\delta V$ in the above.\n",

Note, also, that for $V$ close to $V^0$, the contribution from the first term in the above expression is close to zero.

Further, from the propery of Domain Extension, established for our chosen domains during the existence proof, the $\\ell_1$-norms of all of the relevant maps $\\psi_\\Omega\\circ H$ are less than unity.  Using the above expression (together with the fixed-point equation for $G$) recursively allows us to bound $G'$ over larger intervals extending outside $\\Omega$."
