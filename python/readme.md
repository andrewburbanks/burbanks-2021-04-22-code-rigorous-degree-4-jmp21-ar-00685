### 3 Python code

The python code imports a library of rigorous functions (also provided).  It is based on the 2-variable formulation due to [Eckmann, Koch, Wittwer, 1982 and 1984]. The python implementation of the rigorous framework relies on the decimal module, which conforms to the relevant industry standards, in particular the directed rounding modes. The pathos multiprocessing suite is used to distribute some tasks between processors. The context in the decimal module is per-process so the relevant precision and rounding modes are safe to use in a multiprocessing environment.

#### 3.1 Files

All files are provided as the original Jupyter notebooks and also for convenience of viewing on systems that don't have Jupyter installed, as html files that can be downloaded and viewed in any browser.

1. nonrigorous_starting_points_2019-12-06-0951 (nonrigorousÂ computations to get approximate fixed points)
2. feigenbaum_existence_2019-10-11-1815_180 (proofs; with thorough LaTeX documentation)
3. Rigorous_Framework (the rigorous framework and tests that are imported into the above)
4. rigorous/ (contains the files of the rigorous framework and the unit tests)
5. dat/ (data files generated by 1 (nonrigorous starting points) required for the proof)
6. fig/ (figures generated)
7. plotting.py (convenience plotting functions)
8. renorm.py (some common functions defining the renormalisation operators)
